# Perceptron Gate Detector

A Python-based project that demonstrates how a **Perceptron** can be used to model and detect basic **logic gates**.

## 📌 Description

This project implements a **single-layer perceptron** in Python to simulate the behavior of fundamental logic gates such as:

- AND  
- OR  
- NAND  

The perceptron is trained using labeled input-output pairs and learns to classify the outputs based on weighted sums and an activation function.

The goal of this project is to **demonstrate the core concept of neural networks** and show how a simple perceptron can solve **linearly separable problems** like basic logic gates.
